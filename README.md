# Pump-It-Up


## Introduction

In this Project, I will complete a machine learning workflow using classification solutions, including data preparation, modeling (including hyperparameter tuning), and final model evaluation.


## Business Understanding

Your goal is to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset.

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

##  Data Understanding

The data for this project comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water.

Taarifa is an open source platform for the crowd sourced reporting and triaging of infrastructure related issues.

There are three datasets for this project:

- Test set values (14850 rows × 40 columns)
- Training set labels (59400 rows × 40 columns)
- Training set values (59400 rows × 40 columns)
